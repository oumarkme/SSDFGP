## Main function in this package

## Methods

### The growth curve model

The logistic growth curve model was adopted to fit the relationship between the r-score and the training set size.

$$
y = \frac{\alpha}{1 + \exp(\beta - \gamma x)}
$$

-   $y$: the r-score

-   $x$: training set size

-   $\alpha$: unknown parameter relating to the asymptotic

-   $\beta$: intercept on y-axis

-   $\gamma$: rate at which r-score ([Ou et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00122-019-03387-0)) changes from its initial value

### Procedure

1.  Obtain r-scores for given training set sizes ($n_t$: varying from $n_{min}$ to $n_{max}$ by $\delta$).
2.  Obtain the parameter estimates in the logistic growth curve model.
